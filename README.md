dw_poditems_fetcher
===================

dw_poditems_fetcher is just a very simple/rudimentary podcast downloader, written in Python, that is run directly from the command line. It does basically two things: download the audio mp3 and extract its transcript from the RSS feed itself. At the end, both mp3 and transcript text will reside on a folder determined either by config or defaulted to the local executing folder.
